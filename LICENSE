GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are informed that you are doing these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
   individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of it,
   thereby forming a derivative work. "You" means any person who
   distributes or modifies the Program. 

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
   work.

1. Source Code.

   The source code for a work is the preferred form for making modifications.
   For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for
   all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
   plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
   executable.

   The source code must be made available in the preferred form for making
   modifications to it. The following must be included with the Program:

   a. A copy of this License;

   b. The source code for the Program;

   c. A copy of the corresponding object code.

2. Basic Permissions.

   You are free to use, distribute, and modify the Program as long as you
   follow the conditions set forth in this License.

3. Copyleft.

   You must cause any work that you distribute or publish that is based on
   the Program to be licensed as a whole under this License.

4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   the Program, under the terms of Section 3 of this License, provided that
   you also include the following information:

   a. A copy of this License;

   b. A prominent notice stating that you have modified the Program, and
   giving a relevant date;

   c. A copy of the corresponding object code.

5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a work in object code form under the terms of Section 4
   of this License, provided that you also include the following information:

   a. A copy of this License;

   b. A prominent notice stating that you have modified the Program, and
   giving a relevant date;

   c. The source code of the work.

6. GPL-Compatible Licenses.

   This License is intended to permit you to use software released under
   licenses that are compatible with the GPL.

7. Acceptance.

   This License is automatic; you do not need to accept it in order for it
   to apply to you. However, you can accept it by using the Program. You
   must abide by its terms if you do so.

8. No Warranty.

   The Program is provided without warranty of any kind, either express or
   implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
   merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. 

9. Limitation of Liability.

   In no event will the authors or copyright holders be liable to you for
   damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential
   damages arising out of the use of this License or the Program.

10. Termination.

   You may terminate this License at any time by not using the Program and
   destroying all copies of the Program in your possession.

11. Future Versions.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

12. Compliance with Laws.

   If you are using or distributing the Program, you must comply with all
   applicable laws, regulations, and treaties.
